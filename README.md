## VoucherGen
Simple printable voucher/token slip generator for fairs, events, etc.

<br>

### Features
- Generate printable voucher/token slips in A4 format
- Customizable text and graphics

### Usage
For now, download and extract the repository (green `Code` button near the top), then open `index.html` in your browser.  
No installation or server are required, all data stays on your computer.  
  
Later on I might host a live version online (which will behave exactly the same but will also automatically update to the latest version).
